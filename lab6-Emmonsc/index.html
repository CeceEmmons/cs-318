        <h2>A List Of My Favorite Anime</h2>
        <p>This website is comprised of a list of my favorite anime by two different categories. I decided to split them up by shounen and shoujo anime becuase the anime in each respective category share similarities between them.</p>
        <p>All of the anime in these lists have had some sort of impact on my life that has stuck with me throughout the years and they all hold a special place in my memories.</p>
        <p>Enjoy! :)</p>
